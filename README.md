# Test Task for new Junior Developer applicants

## Main task
Create an app with 3 pages:
- A main page with a list of movies/games likes with a search bar, filter by category;
- Single movie/game page with detailed information;
- Create a new movie/game form with backend validation.

## Bonus
If there is free time left:
- Create an authentication form page (Node.js, Express).
- Movies/Games that are newly added by the authenticated users should be added to the user's favorite movies. 
Later these movies should be visible on a separate route (i.e. liked movies).
